# TimeReversal
 Created in engine version 4.26 with code added as comment for older engine versions
 
 To add the component to any actor, you can blueprint the object and add the Time Reverse blueprint or the native C++ component to the object.
 
Current available options:
1. Maximum reverse time : Will allow the user to adjust how much time should be recorded for time reversal
2. Slow motion multiplier : Default set to 1. Anything below 1 will produce slow motion effects.

These options can be edite both in default settings and per-object instances.
